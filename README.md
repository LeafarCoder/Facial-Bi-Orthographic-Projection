# Facil-Bi-Orthographic-Projection

This project allows the merging of two images into one single cloud of points.
We are able to distinguish both faces rotating the cloud and seeing each face individually.
Each face is 90 degrees apart from each other.

Project done around April 2017.

Here is a showcase of the simulation (around 2 minutes):

As more points are added to the 3D cloud, the faces become more perceptible.
